# 🎯 SQA / SDET Automation Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to test backend software platforms in regulated, logic-heavy environments — aligned with the expectations for modern SQA and SDET roles.

It includes:
- ✅ A simulated casino platform backend built with Express.js
- ✅ Automated tests using Jest and Supertest
- ✅ Structured test documentation (test plans, test cases, and bug reports)
- ✅ Manual test case management and defect tracking using Qase.io
- ✅ Full test coverage of login, signup, spin mechanics, and account management (deposit, withdraw, balance)

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Showcase API test automation with realistic platform and transaction logic
- Emulate system testing workflows used in gaming, financial tech, and regulated industries
- Demonstrate professional documentation practices for functional and edge case coverage
- Highlight a strong QA mindset including both automated and manual validation

## 📣 About Me

I’m a backend engineer pivoting into QA automation with 5+ years of experience building and debugging platform-level systems. I’ve worked closely with QA teams and recently began building automation skills to transition into regulated software testing.

This portfolio is a step toward specializing in automation and quality assurance for critical, logic-heavy systems—like IGT’s gaming platforms.
