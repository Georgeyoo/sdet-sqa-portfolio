# 🎯 SQA / SDET Automation Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to test backend software platforms in regulated, logic-heavy environments — aligned with the expectations for modern SQA and SDET roles.

It includes:
- ✅ A simulated casino platform backend built with Express.js
- ✅ Automated tests using Jest and Supertest
- ✅ Structured test documentation (test plans, test cases, and bug reports)
- ✅ Manual test case management and defect tracking using Qase.io
- ✅ Full test coverage of login, signup, spin mechanics, and account management (deposit, withdraw, balance)

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Showcase API test automation with realistic platform and transaction logic
- Emulate system testing workflows used in gaming, financial tech, and regulated industries
- Demonstrate professional documentation practices for functional and edge case coverage
- Highlight a strong QA mindset including both automated and manual validation
