# Test Plan: Simulated Casino Platform API

## Objective
Ensure the reliability, correctness, and compliance of the simulated casino backend API, mimicking platform-level platform logic similar to systems tested at IGT and regulated gaming environments.

## Scope
- User authentication (Login)
- User registration (Signup)
- Spin mechanics (win/loss/bonus logic)
- User account management (deposit, withdrawal, balance checking)
- Credit balance updates after gameplay and transactions
- Input validation for security and data integrity
- Error handling and edge case validation

## Features Under Test
- `POST /api/login` — User login with email and password
- `POST /api/signup` — User registration with email and password validation
- `POST /api/spin` — Slot machine gameplay simulation
- `POST /api/account/deposit` — Add funds to user account
- `POST /api/account/withdraw` — Withdraw funds from user account
- `GET /api/account/balance` — Retrieve current account balance

## Testing Types
- Functional Testing (happy paths)
- Negative Testing (invalid inputs, boundary conditions)
- Edge Case Validation (e.g., SQL injection attempt, extreme values)
- API Response Structure Validation (JSON keys, status codes, data types)
- Input Validation Testing (email format, password strength)
- Security/Validation Testing (prevent invalid/malicious inputs)

## Tools Used
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) for backend simulation
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as the testing framework
- [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for HTTP request/response assertions
- [Qase.io](https://qase.io) for manual test management and defect tracking

## Test Environment
- Local development environment
- Simulated Express.js API running on localhost
- In-memory state (user accounts and balance managed server-side for test sessions)

## Pass/Fail Criteria
- All valid inputs return correct responses and correct side effects (e.g., balance changes, spin results, account creation).
- Invalid inputs are rejected with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- API responses include correct data structures and types.
- User authentication and registration enforce strict input validation (email format, password strength).
- Game mechanics and account transactions function accurately within defined rules.
- No unhandled server errors or crashes during testing.
